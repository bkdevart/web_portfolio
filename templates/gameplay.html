    <p>
      The data used to create this dashboard consists of two tables:
      one is a log of time spent by day on each game, and the other
      is a record of which games have been completed.  Both are CSV
      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="game-log-overview">game_log.csv</h2>
    <p>
      There are four fields to this table: title, time_played,
      date, and system.
      {{game_log | safe}}
    </p>
    <h2 id="completed-overview">completed.csv</h2>
    <p>
      There are three fields to this table: title, complete,
      date_completed.
      {{completed | safe}}
    </p>
